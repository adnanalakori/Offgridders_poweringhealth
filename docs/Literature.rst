* **Master thesis excerpt**

The Master of Science Thesis *Optimizing the Design of Off-Grid Micro Grids Facing Interconnection with an Unreliable Central Grid Utilizing an Open-Source Simulation Tool* by Martha Hoffmann at the Berlin Institute of Technology developed Offgridders as a tool for a lager study.

* **Presentation on how to use Offgridders**

This presentation describes how to use Offgridders intermediary development versions, ie. V1. There have been a couple of changes by now (most importantly, that there is now an AC and a DC bus, see master thesis excerpt), also comp. the `CHANGELOG.md <https://github.com/rl-institut/offgridders/blob/dev/CHANGELOG.md>`_, so please keep in mind that we are by now at V4!

* **Graphical User Interface of Offgridders (limited functionalities)**

The Off-Grid Test Center developed a web-interface for Offgridders, allowing easy system optimization with few inputs.
